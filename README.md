<h1>Library Management System</h1>
<p>I made this project during my first year DBMS lab to demonstrate my understanding of full stack development for upcoming mini projects. This Library Management System is a comprehensive web-based application for managing library resources.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Library Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing library resources, including books, users, and transactions. It provides a user-friendly interface for library users to search for and borrow books, and for administrators to manage the library's inventory and user transactions.</p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Registration and Login</strong>: Secure user authentication system.</li>
  <li><strong>Book Management</strong>: Users can view available books, borrow, and return them.</li>
  <li><strong>Admin Panel</strong>: Admins can add, update, or remove books and manage user transactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The website is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Data is stored and managed locally on the machine running the application during development.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Frontend</strong>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python</li>
  <li><strong>Backend</strong>: Flask (or another Python web framework), SQLAlchemy</li>
  <li><strong>Database</strong>: SQLite (for local development), MySQL/PostgreSQL (for production)</li>
</ul>
